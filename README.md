# MultiplayerTerminalHangman

## Description
This is a simple Python implementation of Hangman. The game works by having a server host instances of Hangman games. When the server is running, clients can connect to the server and play the game with other clients.

The server side interface allows the user to add new words for use in a game, view the currently logged in clients, or view the hall of fame.

The client side interface allows the user to create a new account, log into an existing account, start a new game of hangman, join a currently running game of hangman, or view the hall of fame.
